# My Projects: Burning Man 2024 Solar EV

For burning man 2024, I had two goals which sadly remain kind of unusual in 2024:
* Drive my EV there
* Power my camp with solar panels

As an auxiliary goal, remembering the crippling heat of 2022, I was hoping to be able to run the AC in the EV for a few hours a day to provide an air-conditioned hidey hole.
I was able to accomplish all of these goals -- sort of!
Here's some photos of my system.
Read on to learn about the process and all the choices and pieces that went into the project.

## Panel Mounting

The Rivian R1S has a glass roof, and is thus a greenhouse.
As an experiment, parked in a sunny spot in my driveway and ran the AC on max.
The car remained somewhere north of 85, and the AC was clearly struggling.

It made sense to use the solar panels to shade the car, which then further implies just mounting the panels on the roof.
Solar panel mounting is somewhat of a black art, so far as my internet research went.
I eventually discovered unistrut, which is available [at my local home depot](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Superstrut-10-ft-12-Gauge-Half-Slotted-Metal-Framing-Strut-Channel-in-Gold-Galvanized-ZA1200HS-10/100125003).
I could mount it to my cargo cross-bars using [t-channel bolts](https://www.rivianforums.com/forum/threads/crossbar-track-bolts-my-findings-what-are-you-using.14193/).
It comes in 10' lengths, and I needed somewhat more, but it was easy to get the necessary hardware to join a 2' length to the 10' length.

All the hardware for this at home depot was 3/8", including these [square washers](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Superstrut-3-8-in-Square-Strut-Washer-Silver-Galvanized-5-Pack-ZAB2413-8EG-10/100390468) which I could use to hold the panels to the strut where two panels abutted.
However, I could not use the square washers to hold the end of the panel -- I needed solar-panel specific [end-clamps](https://amzn.to/4dshqy7).
As solar panels are all made in China, all the hardware is metric -- those end clamps use 8mm bolts.
To make life "simpler" for myself, I wanted to minimize the variety of fasteners, but try as I might I could not find imperial size end clamps.
I ended up using the metric ones, but I drilled the holes out for a 3/8" bolt and used a dremel to grind away some of the metal around the hole so I could get a hex-head bolt to rotate in the tight space.

The end result looks like this:

## Solar Panel Selection

Craigslist is a great place to get solar panels.
My original plan was to buy used panels, which tend to be quite cheap in $/watt, but also have a lower efficiency and so are larger for a given system wattage.
Since I was constrained on space on the top of the car, I ended up getting new panels from a CL reseller.
I ended up with some pretty nice modern bifacial panels at 20.9% efficiency at about $0.31/watt.
[Here's the datasheet](/images/bmsolar/solar-datasheet.pdf) for the panels I used.

I wish I could have found panels that were longer and narrower.
This would have enabled me to put more panels on the roof, but also to have the panels shade the side of the car.
Alas, panels seem to come in generally squarish dimensions.
I ended up with a piece of aluminet hanging off the unistrut for side-shade.

## Electronics

I spent a LOT of time researching solar inverters.

Rivian keeps promising to enable
