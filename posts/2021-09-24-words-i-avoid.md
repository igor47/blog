title: Words I Avoid
---

Language shapes thought -- a.k.a, [the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/sapir-whorf-hypothesis).
There's lots of good evidence for this -- for instance, a very popular study on how Russian's multiple words for shades of blue allow speakers to [more rapidly distinguish between those shades](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11759-russian-speakers-get-the-blues/).

Differences in thought patterns might arise not just between speakers of different languages, but between individuals speaking the same language.
I'm specifically interested, here, in [cognitive distortions](https://www.theschoolofmomentum.com/post/cognitive-distortions), -- a kind of dialect spoken by people who are clustered together, not through physical geography but on a memetic landscape.
Cognitive distortions [are correlated with depression](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01050-7).
There are even claims that [we might be getting more depressed as a society, based on increasing prevalance of cognitive distortions in public text](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/30/e2102061118).

This is interesting, but is a post-hoc justification for a practice that I noticed myself independently adopting.
Language forces a frame of thought, sometimes those frames are not helpful, and language can be a clue that a specific frame is arising.
When I notice myself using these words, this is a clue to myself to pay attention and possibly to re-frame my thinking.
Without further ado, my listsicle.

## SHOULD ##

This is the most common one I notice in myself, and in many of the people in my life.
Often used like "I *should* stop being on the computer so much" or "I *should* exercise more".
An old housemate used to react to *should*s by saying, "Don't *should* all over yourself".

I dislike the way *should* imposes an obligation.
It's not that I *should* go brush my teeth -- it's that I *want* to have healthy teeth and good breath.
Reminding myself of my motivations is often helpful in getting myself to actually do the task.

I also don't like imposing *should*s on others.
Instead of saying "You *should* read X", I could say "I think you would like X".
While reframing in this way, I sometimes realize that I'm not even sure the person would even enjoy X -- I end up simply telling a story, like "I enjoyed X, because..." -- allowing me to share excitement and enthusiasm without adding a TODO to my interlocutor's list.

## MAKE[s] [ME/YOU] FEEL ##

I suffer from the influence of what a wise person I know once called "the control virus" -- the mistaken desire, and belief in the ability to, control outcomes in the world.
For instance, I cannot control the world's climate, or the way the world responds to climate change.
What I can control is how I engage with that problem, how I show up in relationship to it.
Do I avoid thinking about it?
Do I let it dominate my life and take away my joy?

A global catastrophe is a more obvious example.
But the control virus shows up more frequently in interpersonal interactions.
I can't control whether or not my housemate washes their dishes, for instance.
This is insidious because it seems like, if I just ask them "correctly" -- if I say just the right words that would inspire just the right feelings of solidarity and guilt -- then maybe the dishes will get washed after all.
In other words, I would get the outcome that I wanted.

Thinking about life in terms of desired outcomes is a recipe for dissatisfaction.
There is gratitude when my housemate chooses to wash their dishes, while if I somehow controlled their actions via the right words, all I get is smug self-satisfaction.
And what of the alternate scenario?
If they didn't wash their dishes after our conversation, I can be mad at myself for not saying those magic correct words, and mad at the housemate for depriving me of my desired outcome.

I find it helpful, through life, to remind myself that I am fundamentally not in control of outcomes.
All that I can choose -- and even that, with great difficulty -- is how I feel in a given moment.
I can feel drained, avoidant, anxious, and withdrawn from the problem of climate change -- or I can be motivated to engage through feelings of love, the joy of building and creation.
I can be frustrated at my housemate, or I can be curious and supportive of the challenges in their life, and inspired to build a more harmonious household (including by being less frustrated in general).

I think the freedom to choose my own feelings in the moment is the greatest possible freedom.
It often seems non-existent -- always, the temptation to react in a way that I might later regret, not in alignment with the kind of person I would like to cultivate.
So, it is difficult enough to obtain this freedom without constantly, voluntarily surrendering it to others.

This is why *makes me feel* is such a agency-robbing expression.
My usual retort to this, inside my own head, is "nobody can *make* you feel anything!"
People who up in the way that they choose, and then I feel about it the way that I feel.
Sometimes, my reframing of this phrase takes an [NVC](https://www.cnvc.org/learn-nvc/what-is-nvc) turn -- "when you leave your dishes unwashed, I feel...".
When talking of others, I can pivot "I'm sorry I made you feel X" into an opportunity to think about exactly what I said or did that proved a reaction.
For instance, seeing that a person is angry, I can take a moment to think about what I said which provoked anger.
Saying "I'm sorry I said X", instead of "I'm sorry I made you angry" acknowledges the person's feelings and my role in them, while leaving intact their agency in the situation.

## JUST ##

I got this from one of my housemates, who pointed out that the word *just* is often doing a lot of heavy lifting in a sentence.
Having trouble with your boss/spouse/child/pet/inanimate object?
Why not *just* ...?
This can often be quite patronizing.
There's an impression that the solution to a problem is trivial, deadening curiosity through a mistaken belief that you already know the right answer.

There's no catch-all reframing for *just*, but many paths depending on the conversation and relationship.
Is your manager being a jerk in meetings?
A common script devolves into naive solution-ism -- "You could *just* complain to **their** manager!"
When you notice that *just*, that's the cue.
One option is sympathy -- "Damn, that sounds terrible, I would be so mad in your situation."
Another option is collaborative problem solving, but with curiosity -- "Does **their** manager know about this behavior? How would she react if she knew?"

## Putting it all together ##

An Igor of a few years ago might say something like "My manager makes me feel so angry in meetings! I should just go complain to the VP."
A hopefully-more-self-aware Igor of today might notice several opportunities for deeper reflection here.
Why am I feeling angry about the situation?
How can I work, both internally and externally, towards a different reaction in that situation?
Do I want to bring external parties to help mediate the conflict?
Would that help the situation, or escalate it?

The goal is not inactive analysis paralysis.
Instead, I want to give myself the chance to avoid reacting to situations, because my reactions often have the opposite effect from the one I desire.
If I avoid reacting and create spaciousness even in difficult situations, I can use the spaciousness to choose a path most likely to help me feel best in the future.
