A friend once asked me, "Do you believe in ghosts?"
I think this question can be equivalentnly restated as, "Do you believe ghosts are real?", which is slightly easier to answer.

real as unicorns or santa claus?

climate: a new story -- serpent

catholics vs. wiccans -- the pope would be so lost in a wiccan ritual.

overlap with "ground reality".
