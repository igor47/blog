  I'm hosting a lot of my own infrastructure. I want to convince you to do the same.

There's something beautiful and special about open-source software.
It's not perfect by any means, and I don't mean to look at it through rose-tinted glasses.
But -- where else is there a community of practice that brings together so many people from so many different backgrounds to work together on what is essentially a shared project, with no money involved?

I grew up at the same time as the internet, and still remember my youthful, romantic ideas about it.
I read [the Hacker Manifesto](https://www.askapache.com/hacking/hacker-manifesto/) and took it seriously, without a hint of irony.
My ideas even led me to some pretty consequential youthful indiscretions, which are written up elsewhere.

I believe in the [free software movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_movement).
When I read recent books like [Fully Automated Luxury Communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_Automated_Luxury_Communism) or [The Price of Peace](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/14/the-price-of-peace-by-zachary-d-carter-review-how-liberals-betrayed-keynes), it's clear that the ideals of the movement as just as relevant as ever.
I **want** to live in a post-scarcity world, and the clearest hint of this world is in software.

Free software leaves a lot of unanswered questions.
For instance, how do we fund base layer projects that underlie a lot of higher-level infrastructure?
There's even a [relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/2347/) about this.
It ties into a lot of thoughts I have about how meaningful and important work is it's own kind of privilege, which I want to explore in a separate essay.

There are a ton of threads here.
Ideas about collaboration and freedom and economics and futurism.
For me, they all create a desire to interact differently with my software.
I already play the role of *consumer* in almost every other aspect of my life.
Free software allows me to play the role of *participant*, and a participant in something as important as software, which is reshaping our entire world.

This is why I self-host as much of my software as I can.
Why I try to stay away from walled gardens, where companies have taken the fruits of the labor of tens of thousands of open-source contributors, and then used it to build themselves machines of profit.
I don't want to give my data to shadowy corporate entities which will use it against me -- of course they will, the only way these entities have my interests in mind is accidentally or instrumentally, and the moment it's in their interests they'll throw me to the wolves.
I wouldn't expect anything different from entities I have no *relationship* with.
Sure, relationships in free software, interacting through pull requests or Github issues, are fleeting and difficult and sometimes-toxic but it's all real humans interacting as themselves, and that is -- it's **a lot**.

I think this is important


I spend a lot of time thinking about the privilege of meaningful and important work, and how 

I would love to live in a post-scarcity world that Keynes hinted at in [Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren](https://www.aspeninstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/files/content/upload/Intro_and_Section_I.pdf).

Reading recent books like 


I think we live in a golden age of self-hosting.
As someone who has been doing it for a long time, it's clear that it's never been easier.
In the meantime, the drawbacks of what we used to call "your data on someone else's computer" are clearer than ever.
I'd like to describe my vision of how all infrastructure can be self-hosted.
I'd also like to talk about WHY.

## Start With Why

This is a tough section to write, because I'm partly going on intuition..
When I first opted out of social networks like Facebook, back in 2014 or so, I wasn't doing it because I had a well-developed critique of the dangers of these platforms.
It just felt like they were bad for me, trying to suck my attention in a way I didn't like by inspiring feelings I didn't like.
Only later did people like [Tristan Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristan_Harris) and [Jaron Lanier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaron_Lanier) come along to articulate the dangers of these platforms.

I have the same sense about cloud computing services in general.
Some of the dangers are connected to the critiques of social media.
For instance, through GMail, Google Docs, maps, photos, etc..., Google has a pretty complete picture of our life.
It can use this data to show you ads, sell you products, or manipulate your behavior.
If the CIA was building a similar dossier on you, you would be rightly concerned and upset, yet you're giving this data to Google for free.

Some of these concerns have to do with the continued independence of the internet.
If you only use Google Chrome, then you 

For instance, Google can use all the data in gabout how and with whom you communicate to surveil you, sell you ads, or manipulate your behavior.

Yuval Noah Harrari's book "Homo Deus" closes with the question:

> "What will happen to society, politics and daily life when non-conscious but highly intelligent algorithms know us better than we know ourselves?"

The purpose of most of your cloud services is to know you better than you know yourself.
It's not a conspiracy theory to say that tech companies exist to make money by selling you products.
There's nothing wrong with buying or selling products.

what about epistomology?


Tech companies are not your friends.
They're there to sell you a product.
This is fine -- there's nothing wrong with buying or selling products.
But I have a sense that some things shouldn't be commodified.

For example, gmail is probably the most popular cloud service.
If you want to get in touch with someone, it's likely your communication with them exists entirely within the gmail ecosystem.
Gmail is using this data to better target ads at you.
In "Homo Deux", Yval Noah Harrari 


I'd like to jump into the drawbacks for a moment, and then talk about how I think 
It's become easier than ever, even while the drawbacks of the cloud are greater than ever.

I've been hosting my own infrastructure since long before the advent of cloud computing.
Back in my day, we called that whole cloud thing "your data on someone else's computer".
Of course, these days, it's pretty standard for all of your data -- email, documents, financial records, photos, etc. -- to live on someone else's computer.
It's convenient, but there are drawbacks.
