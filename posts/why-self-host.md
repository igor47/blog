  I'm hosting a lot of my own infrastructure. I want to convince you to do the same.

There's something beautiful and special about open-source software.
It's not perfect by any means, and I don't mean to look at it through rose-tinted glasses.
But -- where else is there a community of practice that brings together so many people from so many different backgrounds to work together on what is essentially a shared project, with no money involved?

I grew up at the same time as the internet, and still remember my youthful, romantic ideas about it.
I read [the Hacker Manifesto](https://www.askapache.com/hacking/hacker-manifesto/) and took it seriously, without a hint of irony.
My ideas even led me to some pretty consequential youthful indiscretions, which are written up elsewhere.

I believe in the [free software movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_movement).
When I read recent books like [Fully Automated Luxury Communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_Automated_Luxury_Communism) or [The Price of Peace](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/14/the-price-of-peace-by-zachary-d-carter-review-how-liberals-betrayed-keynes), it's clear that the ideals of the movement as just as relevant as ever.
I **want** to live in a post-scarcity world, and the clearest hint of this world is in software.

Free software leaves a lot of unanswered questions.
For instance, how do we fund base layer projects that underlie a lot of higher-level infrastructure?
There's even a [relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/2347/) about this.
It ties into a lot of thoughts I have about how meaningful and important work is it's own kind of privilege, which I want to explore in a separate essay.

There are a ton of threads here.
Ideas about collaboration and freedom and economics and futurism.
For me, they all create a desire to interact differently with my software.
I already play the role of *consumer* in almost every other aspect of my life.
Free software allows me to play the role of *participant*, and a participant in something as important as software, which is reshaping our entire world.

This is why I self-host as much of my software as I can.
Why I try to stay away from walled gardens, where companies have taken the fruits of the labor of tens of thousands of open-source contributors, and then used it to build themselves machines of profit.
I don't want to give my data to shadowy corporate entities which will use it against me -- of course they will, the only way these entities have my interests in mind is accidentally or instrumentally, and the moment it's in their interests they'll throw me to the wolves.
I wouldn't expect anything different from entities I have no *relationship* with.
Sure, relationships in free software, interacting through pull requests or Github issues, are fleeting and difficult and sometimes-toxic but it's all real humans interacting as themselves, and that is -- it's **a lot**.

You don't want to self-host anything.
It's much more convenient to outsource your email to Google, your music listening to Spotify, your thinking to Twitter.
But you probably don't enjoy living in a meaningless world where your voice is drowned out and huge forces outside your control seem to shape your future.
