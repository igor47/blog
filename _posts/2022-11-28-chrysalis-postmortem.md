title: "Chrysalis House: A Postmortem"
draft: true
---

In October of 2019, a group of four friends and I bought a beautiful historic house in Berkeley.
We named it "Chrysalis House", a name that symbolized to us a place that we can pour our hearts into, and that would be a safe haven for transformation.
I moved into the house in November 2019, full of excitement and optimism and enthusiasm and hopes and dreams.
In August of 2022, I fled the house in disarray, becoming (for now) a nomad with no fixed address while I figure my life out.
Not only did my dream of having a permanent fixed base in Berkeley not materialize, but my relationships with my co-owners -- the folks I trusted enough to buy real estate with them -- have been pretty severely damaged.

What happened?
I've been asking myself this question for 6 months now.
This post is a flailing attempt to turn this disorienting experience into something that makes sense.
I'm writing it for my friends, who've been asking.
I'm writing it for other folks who are involved in co-living or community housing.
We've always wanted our house to be an example of how to do it -- an example of how NOT to do it is similarly illustrative.
Finally, I'm writing it for myself.
I've been telling myself that the upside of this experience has been that "at least I learned something".
What did I actually learn, if anything?
I'm hoping this post will help me figure that out.

## Our Structure

Chrysalis is a 4000 square foot historic home in Berkeley.
Besides five official bedrooms, it has a mudroom, a living room, a dining room, an office, a den, and some assorted other rooms.
We structured the house as an 8-bedroom house with common spaces including a media/den room, dining room, office, and a giant great hall that we envisioned as a place for community gathering and events.
We decided to go with 8 bedrooms to make the home as affordable as possible, and this still left us with plenty of common space.

The house was co-owned by five of the residents, which we called Chrysalis Owners.
I own a 25% stake in the house, and my name is also on the mortgage.
We additionally had 3 more residents who lived in the house but were not owners.
We decided to structure the house so that most day-to-day decision-making would fall to the broader group.
The Owners group was tasked with upkeep, maintenance, and external finances, while decisions like how to fill rooms, how much each room costs, how to organize groceries or cleaning or events would all fall on the broader group.
Owners would have no additional power in day-to-day decisions beyond the voice they had as residents.

We spent a lot of time on legal structure, tax treatment, how to arrange finances and maintenance budgets, and how to set fair rent.
I think we actually did a good job in many of these areas, or at least these were not a source of conflict for us.
I might write a separate post on the things we did that worked well for us, because I think many co-owned community houses have to solve these same problems, and we solved them well.

## Shared Vision -- or Lack Thereof

A popular book in co-living communities is [Creating a Life Together](https://bookshop.org/p/books/creating-a-life-together-practical-tools-to-grow-ecovillages-and-intentional-communities-diana-leafe-christian/8072826).
This book outlines all the steps for creating a co-living community in exhaustive detail, but it spends the first two chapters on vision.
Along with how-to guides on creating a vision, the book goes into the kinds of problems that occur when a group boots up without having hashed out a shared vision in advance:

> They couldn’t understand why their conflict was so intense. Why were they so at odds with each other? What was wrong with those other people? Finally the group called in a group process consultant who asked each member to fill out a questionnaire about what they valued and aspired to in their community. The questionnaire revealed that community members lived in either one of two subtle but different paradigms of reality... Some community members believed the first was the community’s reason for being, others believed the second — and until that time no one knew the other reality existed. It was a stunning revelation. Different people had different visions, which they incorrectly assumed everyone shared. Although by this time people were arguing most of the time, their core problem wasn’t interpersonal conflict. Their problem was structural — built into the system. Theirs was definitely a “time-bomb” kind of conflict, with members unable to see it’s not that “John’s being unreasonable” or “Sue’s irresponsible again,” but that John and Sue were each operating from a different assumption about why the community was there in the first place. And what should they do with such structural conflict? Which people should stay in the community and which had the “wrong” vision and should move out?

The Chrysalis Owners group did eventually read a part of this book together, two years into our co-living tenure, and paragraphs like this resonated ominously for us.
By this point, we were already aware of two different visions that we entered into the house with, and it was pretty late to resolve the difference.
The two visions for us were:

* We're a community of friends/chosen family, and our primary responsibility is to one another, the specific people in our specific house
* We're a community organization with a mission in the world, and our primary responsibility is a cause or set of external causes which we collectively pursue

In the first vision, we would pick new members primarily on how much we like them and have shared interests.
We'd ask and expect that members would join our social lives -- that we'd be more friends than housemates.
One of us moving out is a kind of failure, like a divorce in a marriage, since the commitment we had was to one another.

In the second vision, we would pick members primarily based on how much they advance our shared cause.
Individual members moving out is fine, so long as we continue to pursue our shared cause together.
We wouldn't be expected to share social lives, but we would be expected to devote a lot of time to our cause area.

To at least some extent, the Chrysalis owners were excited about both visions.
However, when push came to shove, I discovered that I was very much a vision-1 devotee, and surprisingly at odds with the vision-2 folks.
We already discussed this difference in vision in summer of 2021, when we were filling two rooms, and we never addressed it together.
I think at that time, we had more vision-1 folks in the house, but vision-2 folks found additional vision-2 folks to join the house.
More about those later.

A learning for myself at this time was about speaking up and expressing my preferences.
I was very much the driving force behind forming the house, setting it's structure, and recruiting the initial group of people.
At some point, I heard from a vision-2 co-owner that they were kind of resentful about the extent to which I was the "leader" of the house.
So, in 2021, when we were recruiting new housemates, I took a step back and was less vocal about my preferences in an effort to appease the vision-2 co-owner.
As a result, the house became more evenly split between vision-1 and vision-2 folks.
In hindsight, concealing my preferences in a silent attempt to appease a housemate (or anyone, really) is not an ideal approach for life.
I've learned to be mindful of the potential for such situations.
Failing-fast because you've discovered an incompatibility is much-preferred to failing-slow because you've attempted to sweep an incompatibility under the rug and failed.

## COVID

The initial group of residents finished moving into Chrysalis in February 2020.
A month later, we were in lockdown.
Dealing with COVID was an ever-present reality in a shared house of 8 people, and was the proximate cause of my eventually leaving the house.

COVID was a huge setback for our initial vision.
We had been hoping to be a social hub, a place for gatherings and events and community.
Instead, we spent months assembly-line disinfecting groceries before they came in through the door -- definitely no outside people allowed!
We also did not plan to all be in the house, all be in the house all of the time together.
We originally had separate workplaces, separate friends, separate lives, which COVID flattened.

I think that COVID created a fundamental re-alignment of how people can choose housemates.
Previously, you might be asking potential housemates about their noise or cleanliness preferences.
In fact, COVID-related preferences trump all of those considerations.

Today, COVID is over for me.
I don't take any special precautions I wouldn't have taken in 2019, except that I might wear a mask if I'm actively sick and need to run an errand.
I actively avoid going into businesses (mostly found in Berkeley in my experience) that have a "Mask still required" sign on their doors.

Of the members of Chrysalis in 2022, there are still people who wear a mask to most public gatherings.
More, I seems to me that they have a moral judgement about my approach.
I have heard that I am selfish, that I am not considering the needs of people with special health considerations, that I'm failing to do my public duty to contain the pandemic.

These differences emerged pretty soon after lockdowns.
By summer 2020, it seemed to me like we were taking more precautions than was necessary for people our age.
I pinned my hopes of release on vaccines, and indeed there was a brief relaxing in our vigilance in summer of 2021, but it was quickly undone by the delta wave in August.
For another year, as I tried to continue to make Chrysalis work, I continued to engage in our collective COVID deliberation.
We crafted an ever-shifting policy, covering things like which gatherings we could attend, under what situations we would have to wear a mask in public, which situations warranted masking inside the house, which friends could visit the house under what conditions.

Through this time, I occasionally attempted to advocate for an approach that was preferable to me.
I felt that everyone could just go about their lives as they wished, and I was willing to let people know when I engaged in activities they might find risky, so that they could take their own precautions.
Instead, the dialog was around the duty I had to keep my housemates feeling safe at the cost to limiting my activities.
A housemate once said to me in a house meeting, "I don't feel like wearing a mask in my own house because you went to a party".
Of course, the alternative was me wearing a mask in the house because I went to a party, but the implication was that going to the party was selfish and short-sighted, and I should reconsider my life choices.

We drew an equivalence that seems unwarranted to me.
On the one hand, I wanted to live my life, and let my housemates live their lives, in a way that seems right and good to them.
On the other hand, housemates wanted me to take active action to keep them feeling safe.
The compromise we drew seemed to me to be, "Okay, you can live your life differently than how you want, and in exchange I will ask you to make changes that are less than the maximal requests I would prefer".
When I'm feeling more charitable, I re-frame the compromise as "We both want to live in the house together, and so I will sacrifice some of my feeling of safety, and you will compromise some of your social life."
But it's hard for me to escape my original framing.
Especially difficult, when it was hard to see why I would sacrifice my out-of-the-house social life given that our life in the house consisted entirely of COVID negotiations/restrictions, plus constant conflict over social justice (see below).

In summer of 2022, our COVID policy required that if I go to an event over a certain size without masking, I would have to quarantine in my room afterwards.
This meant wearing a mask in common spaces, including to cook in the kitchen.
I wanted to go to an event, and I did *not* want to comply with our negotiated consequences.
The correct approach for me at the time was to convene our COVID committee and try to modify the policy, but our COVID committee had mostly dissolved since we were all at each other's throats at the time.
In any case, I was pretty done with the countless hours we had spent negotiating COVID.
I simply announced that I would go to the party and would not mask afterwards.
This resulted in a shitstorm.
Every co-owner told me I was being selfish and hurtful.
A housemate accused my email of giving her an ulcer.
Another housemate wrote to me the most hurtful email I had ever received, in which she accused me of being a perpetrator of injustice, and of everyone in my life of being an enabler akin to those who enable some of the worst problems of our society.
It was this final conflict which cemented my decision to leave the house.
