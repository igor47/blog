title: Reflections on Leaving Aclima
draft: true
---

From December 2018 until May of 2020, I worked as a software engineer at [Aclima](https://aclima.io/).
This post is my attempt to summarize that experience.
Among the things I'd like to cover: why I worked at Aclima, what I did while I was there, and what I learned from my time there.

## Why Aclima ##

I [left Airbnb](thoughts-on-leaving-airbnb) in April 2017, and then took over a year to recover from burn-out and restore my body and mind.
In the summer of 2018, I was ready to look for work again.
My primary goal was to find work in a field that I truly cared about -- specifically, climate change.
Failing that, I would fall back to the ([now less-favored](https://80000hours.org/2015/07/80000-hours-thinks-that-only-a-small-proportion-of-people-should-earn-to-give-long-term/)) "[Earning to Give](https://80000hours.org/articles/earning-to-give/)]" strategy from [80,000 hours](https://80000hours.org/).

During my job search, I discovered that, [profestations to the contrary](http://paulgraham.com/ambitious.html), there was not a whole lot of impactful work going on in SV.
Most companies in the Bay are consumer-focused or B2C SAS, and there's not a ton of relevance from that to what I think are the real problems of the world.
I was on the verge of accepting a job with a popular chat app maker when I learned about Aclima.

### Aclima's Mission ###

(Note: this is Aclima's mission as it appeals to me, not necessarily as others at Aclima might describe it).
It's kind of hard to make progress on the vast and nebulous (forgive the pun) problem of "climate change".
Where do you even start?
How do you know if you're helping?
How do you get buy-in for change?
Is there even room for technology to help (I've reflected on this more, [here](https://igor.moomers.org/what-is-to-be-done]))?

Aclima doesn't directly work on climate change, but on the more narrow issue of air pollution and air quality.
The goal is to capture very accurate and very local measurements of air quality over time, and work with communities and regulators to improve those numbers.
It's a very technical product -- there's a lot of room for skilled technologists to contribute -- and very quantitative, so it's very clear if it's working over time.
And the potential impact can scale far beyond local air quality, because it can activate local communities to get serious about the environment.
I see this as a kind of gateway to more long-term climate activism.

## What I Worked On ##

When I started at Aclima, it was in the kk


I've tended to follow a [strong opinions, weakly held](https://www.saffo.com/02008/07/26/strong-opinions-weakly-held/) philosphy when making decisions, but, as [others have pointed out](https://commoncog.com/blog/strong-opinions-weakly-held-is-bad/), this doesn't necessarily work well, and can be a costly way to learn.
My time at Aclima has given me a concrete example of doing insufficient validation.
In the future, I hope to either be more systematic about formulating and then disproving alternative hypotheses ("what if this role is not a good match for me?", "what if the company ends up growing less rapidly?", "what if the career growth I hope for won't materialize?"), or setting hard deadlines on validation timelines (aka, [get compact](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/09/23/out-to-get-you/)).
