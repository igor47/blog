There are a lot of complicated ideas intertwined here, so lets work through an example with some numbers.
Many environmentalists support a carbon tax to drive lower emissions.
[A recent study](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/7/20/17584376/carbon-tax-congress-republicans-cost-economy) looked at several potential prices, with $50 per ton as a baseline number but numbers as high as [$250 per ton in the United States](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/fileadmin/user_upload/research/workingpapers/wp1109.pdf).
A round-trip flight from SFO to JFK might be around 0.8 tons of CO2, and costs maybe $350, so a CO2 tax would add between 10% and 50% to the cost of the airfare (assuming the cost is just passed on to the consumer).
For the median Californian, who makes $63k per year, this might be a meaningful increase in cost that would actually drive down consumption.

What about my wealthy Bay Area friends?
If you made a few million bucks off a pre-IPO sale of Airbnb stock, you probably don't care.
If you decided to go to NYC, you wouldn't hesitate to buy the flight and you might even throw in a few bucks extra for the carbon offset while you're at it.
In our utopian future, where climate catastrophe has been averted, do the rich just get to keep living their lives, while the life horizon of the poor is curtailed?
